# Task 1: Importing and Validating a Form
In the first task, you'll get started by importing a pre-created custom input form into the LO Connect Admin Portal. We'll then verify that it works as expected before moving on to the other tasks.

## Prerequisites
This task requires: 
* An administrator Encompass Login that can be used to access [LO Connect](https://www.encompassloconnect.com)
* A non-Administrator Encompass Login that can be used to access [LO Connect](https://www.encompassloconnect.com)

# Instructions
Follow the steps below to complete this task. The files in this folder provide the initial form image you'll need for this task.

1. Using Chrome, log into the [LO Connect](https://www.encompassloconnect.com) web site using your administrator credentials.
2. On the left-hand navigation, select `Input Forms > Custom Forms`.
3. Click the `Import` button and select the [Experience 19 Demo Form.zip](Experience+19+Demo+Form.zip) file included in this task's GitHub folder. Once completed, you should have a form named "Experience 19 Demo Form".
4. Click the `Enabled` checkbox for the new form to allow it to be visible in LO Connect.
5. Open a new browser tab and log into LO Connect with a non-administrator credential.
6. On the Pipeline screen, select any sample loan to open it in the editor. (Please do not experiment on an actual loan file!)
7. On the left-hand navigation, select `Forms > Custom Input Forms > Experience 19 Demo Form`. The form should appear and be populated with data. Try modifying one of the data elements, e.g. the Borrower's Name, and verify that the name changes in the header bar of the editor.

The demo form is now loaded and ready for the tasks that follow. You can move on to Task #2.
